# Committing changesPermalink

Each time you have a set of changes ready to share with your team, youâ€™ll be going through the following process to stage and commit them in git:

    * Stage the changes to commit - git add <FILES TO ADD>
    * Check that the changes are valid and complete, with no missing meta files, duplicate GUIDs etc.
    * Commit the change - git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE>"
    * Push the changes to GitHub - git push
